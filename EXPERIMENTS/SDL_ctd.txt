Comment: Formulating the Chisholm contrary to duty puzzle for SDL as in this paper, with s = X steals and p = X is punished. This follows the ontology-oriented translation, wherein each element of each variant of the Chisholm set is given a name. We consider more variants of the normative regimes as well.
